    - **Pre-migration Analysis:**
        - **Identify Incompatibilities:** Use SCTâ€™s assessment report to identify and address any incompatibilities between the source and target databases early in the process.
        - **Dependencies:** Ensure that all database dependencies (e.g., functions, procedures, triggers) are considered during migration.
    - **Automation:**
        - **Automate Where Possible:** Use scripts and automation tools to streamline repetitive tasks in the migration process.
        - **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate SCT with your CI/CD pipeline to automate schema conversion and deployment processes using tools like AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFormation, and CI/CD platforms.
    - **Collaboration:**
        - **Team Collaboration:** Foster collaboration among database administrators, developers, and testers to ensure a smooth migration process.
        - **Knowledge Sharing:** Share knowledge and best practices within your team to handle migration challenges effectively.

    st.markdown("""
    - **Feature Gaps:** Be aware of any gaps between source and target database features. SCT may not support certain database-specific functionalities.
    - **Complex Schemas:** SCT might struggle with very complex schemas or highly customized objects, requiring manual intervention.
    - **Performance Impact:** SCT can impact performance during schema conversion, especially for large and complex databases. Ensure that adequate resources are allocated.
