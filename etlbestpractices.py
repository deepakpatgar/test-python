error_handling_tips = """
### Error Handling Best Practices
1. **Logging:** Ensure all ETL processes have comprehensive logging to capture errors, warnings, and important information.
2. **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.
3. **Validation:** Perform data validation checks at each stage of the ETL pipeline.
4. **Alerts:** Set up alerts for critical failures.
5. **Error Isolation:** Isolate and handle errors without stopping the entire pipeline.
6. **Transaction Management:** Use transactions to ensure data consistency and rollback in case of failures.

"""

partitioning_tips = """
### Partitioning Best Practices
1. **Range Partitioning:** Use range partitioning for time-series data to optimize queries.
2. **Hash Partitioning:** Use hash partitioning for evenly distributing data across partitions.
3. **Composite Partitioning:** Combine range and hash partitioning for complex data sets.
4. **Partition Pruning:** Ensure queries can take advantage of partition pruning to improve performance.
5. **Partition Maintenance:** Regularly maintain and manage partitions (e.g., merging old partitions, archiving).

"""

etl_methods_tips = """
### ETL Methods Best Practices
1. **Incremental Load:** Use incremental loading to update only changed data.
2. **Batch Processing:** Use batch processing for large data sets to manage resources effectively.
3. **Stream Processing:** Use stream processing for real-time data ingestion and transformation.
4. **Data Staging:** Use staging areas to temporarily hold data before final processing.
   - **Isolation:** Keep the staging area isolated from production environments to prevent accidental data corruption.
   - **Security:** Implement strong security measures to protect sensitive data in the staging area.
   - **Cleanup:** Regularly clean up the staging area to avoid storage bloat and maintain performance.
5. **ETL Scheduling:** Schedule ETL processes during off-peak hours to minimize impact on production systems.

"""

parallel_run_tips = """
### Parallel Run of Legacy and Modern Cloud Platforms Best Practices
1. **Dual Write:** Implement dual write mechanisms to ensure data consistency across platforms.
2. **Data Sync:** Regularly synchronize data between legacy and cloud platforms.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of both platforms.
4. **Fallback Mechanism:** Have a fallback mechanism in case of failures in the modern platform.
5. **Cutover Planning:** Plan and execute a detailed cutover strategy for final migration.
   - **Testing:** Perform extensive testing in the new environment before cutover.
   - **Communication:** Keep all stakeholders informed about the cutover schedule and any potential downtime.
   - **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case issues arise during the cutover.
   - **Post-Cutover Validation:** Validate data integrity and system functionality after the cutover.

"""

data_transformations_tips = """
### Data Transformations Best Practices
1. **Normalization:** Normalize data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
2. **Data Enrichment:** Enrich data with additional attributes for better insights.
3. **Data Cleansing:** Perform data cleansing to handle missing, duplicate, and erroneous data.
4. **Transformation Logic:** Keep transformation logic simple and maintainable.
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test transformations to ensure accuracy.
"""

table_datatypes_tips = """
### Table Data Types and Length Best Practices
1. **Data Type Selection:** Choose appropriate data types to optimize storage and performance.
2. **Length Specification:** Specify lengths for string types to avoid unnecessary storage consumption.
3. **Consistent Data Types:** Maintain consistent data types across tables to ensure compatibility.
4. **Null Handling:** Define nullability based on business requirements.
5. **Default Values:** Use default values where applicable to handle missing data.
"""

etl_audit_tips = """
### ETL Audit, Balance, and Control Framework Best Practices
1. **Audit Trails:** Implement comprehensive audit trails to track all ETL activities and changes.
2. **Data Balancing:** Ensure data is balanced between source and destination to verify completeness.
3. **Control Points:** Introduce control points at critical stages to validate data accuracy.
4. **Reconciliation:** Regularly reconcile data to identify and correct discrepancies.
5. **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for anomalies detected during the ETL process.
6. **Error Reporting:** Provide detailed error reporting to facilitate quick resolution.
7. **Review and Validation:** Periodically review and validate the audit and control mechanisms to ensure effectiveness.
"""

etl_performance_tips = """
### ETL Performance Best Practices
1. **Optimize Queries:** Ensure that all SQL queries are optimized for performance.
2. **Indexing:** Use indexing to speed up data retrieval.
3. **Parallel Processing:** Implement parallel processing to handle large data volumes efficiently.
4. **In-Memory Processing:** Use in-memory processing where possible to reduce I/O operations.
