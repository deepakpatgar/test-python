- **Assign Memory**: Allocate memory to WLM queues based on the requirements of the workloads.
- **Concurrency Levels**: Set appropriate concurrency levels to balance resource usage and query performance.
- **Queue Prioritization**: Prioritize critical workloads by assigning them to dedicated WLM queues with higher resources.
- **Query Monitoring**: Use Query Monitoring Rules (QMR) to manage long-running or resource-intensive queries.
    ```json
    {
        "query_monitoring_rules": [
            {
                "rule_name": "long_running_query",
                "predicate": "query_time > 300000",
                "action": "log"
            },
            {
                "rule_name": "high_memory_query",
                "predicate": "memory_to_disk > 1000000000",
                "action": "abort"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- **Short Query Acceleration (SQA)**: Enable SQA to prioritize short-running queries and improve overall performance.
    - `enable_short_query_acceleration = true`
- **Slot Count**: Adjust slot count per queue based on the complexity and resource requirements of queries.
- **User and Query Groups**: Use user groups and query groups to route different workloads to appropriate WLM queues.
- **Dynamic WLM**: Use Dynamic WLM to automatically adjust memory allocation and concurrency based on workload demands.
- **Queue Hopping**: Enable queue hopping to allow queries to move to another queue if the original queue is full.
- **Monitoring and Tuning**: Continuously monitor WLM performance and tune settings based on observed workload patterns.
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance tasks during off-peak hours to minimize impact on query performance.
- **Event Handling**: Set up event handling for specific WLM events to automate responses to workload changes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance metrics such as queue wait times, query execution times, and resource utilization.
- **Logging**: Enable and review WLM logs to diagnose and resolve performance issues.
- **Workload Analysis**: Regularly analyze workload patterns to identify opportunities for optimization.
- **Cluster Resize**: Consider resizing the Redshift cluster to better match workload demands during peak and off-peak times.
